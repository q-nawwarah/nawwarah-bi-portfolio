# Sales KPI Power BI Dashboard (2014)

An executive-style **Power BI** dashboard designed to track **actual revenue vs monthly targets**, profitability, and sales performance across key markets. This project demonstrates how **business goals, KPIs, and data modeling** come together to support better decision-making.

---

## Business Problem

Sales leaders need to know:

* Are we hitting our **monthly revenue targets**?
* Which months and markets are **under- or over-performing**?
* Is revenue growth being achieved **profitably**?

In many organizations, these answers are spread across multiple spreadsheets, making it hard to quickly detect problems or opportunities. This project simulates how a centralized BI dashboard can replace manual reporting with **real-time, decision-ready insights**.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

**Power BI • DAX (KPIs & Time Intelligence) • Data Modeling • Sales Performance Analysis • Business Storytelling**

---

## How the Solution Works

The dashboard was built using a **clean BI data model**:

* **Financials (Fact Table)** – Sales, Profit, Date, Product, Country
* **Date (Dimension)** – Calendar with month and year
* **Targets (Fact)** – Monthly revenue targets aligned to the Date table

Using **DAX**, dynamic measures were created for:

* Actual Sales
* Target Sales
* Sales Variance & Variance %
* Profit & Profit Margin
* Month-over-Month (MoM) growth

This ensures **accurate month-level comparisons** between actual performance and business targets.

---

## Key Insights

* **Sales performance varied across the year**, with both over- and under-target months — giving a realistic view of execution vs plan
* **Strong peaks** in June, October, and December indicate clear **seasonal demand patterns**
* Several **mid-year months missed targets**, highlighting possible pricing, demand, or discounting issues
* **Profit margin remained stable (~14%)**, showing healthy profitability despite revenue fluctuations
* The **United States and Canada** contributed the largest share of revenue

---

## Business Impact

This dashboard enables management to:

* **Track target achievement** at a monthly level
* **Identify risk periods early** when sales fall below expectations
* **Understand seasonality** to set more realistic future targets
* **Balance growth and profitability** using margin trends
* **Compare country performance** to focus on the strongest markets

It replaces manual reporting with a **single, trusted view of financial performance**.

---

## Outcome

* Executive-ready **Power BI dashboard** with dynamic KPIs
* Accurate **Sales vs Target** tracking using validated DAX
* Clear visibility into **trends, risks, and opportunities**
* A **scalable BI model** that can be extended to YoY analysis, new regions, or future targets
