# Sales Overview Dashboard (Tableau)

An interactive **Tableau** dashboard built on data prepared in **Google BigQuery** to analyze **Superstore’s sales performance (2014–2017)** and support data-driven product, regional, and revenue decisions.

## Business Problem

Retail leaders need to understand:

* How **seasonality and product concentration** affect business risk

When this information is scattered across raw tables or spreadsheets, it becomes difficult to spot opportunities or risks. This project simulates how a **BI dashboard** can provide a single, executive-ready view of sales performance.
